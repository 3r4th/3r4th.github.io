                    <p>Today we‚Äôre going to cover one aspect of static analysis by looking at an unpacked <b> password
                            stealer</b> that may run silently in the background and may not provide any indication of
                        infection
                        to you as a user.</p>
                    <p>If you want to know why we analyze malware and the different approaches that exist, check my
                        previous post : <a href="malware_overview.html" target="_blank">Can we know what malware is
                            hiding ?</a></p>
                    <p>To better understand, I recommend you do it at the same time but you must already have an
                        isolated and virtual environment so as not to infect your real machine üòâ</p>
                    <p>Personally, I use FLARE-VM which comes with all the necessary tools for malware analysis, but you
                        can use a simple windows virtual machine insteadüòä. The link to download the malware ‚ò† is at the
                        bottom. Now let‚Äôs jump in ‚òïÔ∏è :</p>
                    <h2>1. Identify the file type, target OS and architecture :</h2>
                    <p>First of all we have to identify the file type because it helps us to know the target OS (Windows
                        or Linux ‚Ä¶) and the corresponding architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).</p>
                    <p>On Windows, an executable is called a <b>PE</b> which stands for <b>Portable Executable</b> and
                        it can
                        be of
                        different formats exe, dll, sys, etc ‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p>In order to do this we‚Äôre going to open our malware with 3 different tools : <b>PEstudio</b>,
                        <b>CFF explorer</b> and <b>Exeinfo PE</b></p>
                    <div class="box alt">
                        <div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
                            <div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/1.png" alt="" /></span></div>
                            <div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/2.png" alt="" /></span></div>
                            <div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/3.png" alt="" /></span></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Good, now we know that is a Win32 DLL (dynamic-link-library) and its an executable because of the
                        MIME type (first-bytes = MZ) and it‚Äôs targeting a 32-bit MS Windows (GUI). </p>
                    <h2>2. Generate a hash of the malware :</h2>
                    <p>Next step is to generate a hash of our malware to see if anyone else has analyzed it before, for
                        this either we use the above tools or we use an other one called <b>HashCalc</b> : </p>
                    <p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/4.png" alt="" /></span>As we can see, the tool
                        gives us different hashes (fingerprints) using different algorithms (MD5, SHA1 ‚Ä¶), so we just
                        need to search on websites like <b>VirusTotal</b> or <b>HybridAnalysis</b> for previous
                        detections or to check if it has been analyzed before by an other one üòâ</p>
                    <h2>3. Get all strings :</h2>
                    <p>Extracting readable characters gives us an idea of what the malware can do. Basically we look for
                        file names, domain names the malware connects to (URLs), IP addresses, Registry keys, etc ‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p>Note that attackers üòà may also include fake or garbage characters to disrupt our analysis. Again
                        with <b>PEstudio</b> we can extract a lot of information :</p>
                    <p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/5.png" alt="" /></span>As we can see, we have a few URLs
                        and a POST request, so probably these domains belong to a C&C server and the malware
                        communicates with it by sending back credentials and gathered information üò≤</p>
                    <p>Now, if we navigate through the blacklist filter, we‚Äôll see that it calls Windows-specific
                        functions as shown below : </p>
                    <p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/6.png" alt="" /></span>We can therefore assume that it
                        uses system functions to enumerate usernames, passwords, services, etc ‚Ä¶, and send them back to
                        the attacker ü§î. You get the idea üí°, now look at the rest in detail to fully understand
                        what it does. </p>
                    <h2>4. Analyze the PE header :</h2>
                    <p> Deep analysis of the PE header reveals a lot of information about the malware‚Äôs capacity.
                        Basically, we are looking at what subsystem is used, whether the executable is packed or not,
                        and what libraries are required for its functionality. </p>
                    <p>Before we start, we must first understand the structure of a PE header ü§ì. The PE format is a
                        data structure that encapsulates the information necessary for the Windows OS loader to manage
                        the wrapped executable code, it contains :
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>DOS header</b> : defines the file as an executable binary.</li>
                            <li><b>DOS stub</b> : message to the user and exit if the binary file is run under MS-DOS.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>File header</b> : defines the signature, compiler-stamp, etc ‚Ä¶</li>
                            <li><b>Optional header</b> : information about subsystem, entry-point, etc ‚Ä¶</li>
                            <li><b>Sections table</b> : tells how to load the executable in memory.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Then we have sections : <b>.text .rdata .data .reloc .rsrc</b> ‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre going to mainly use
                        <b>PEstudio</b> &
                        <b>CFF explorer</b> but the same results can be achieved using other tools üòá
                    </p>
                    <h3>DOS header :</h3>
                    <p>With <b>CFF explorer</b>, we can see immediately the value of the <b>DOS header</b> :</p>
                    <p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/7.png" alt="" /></span>The first two bytes in
                        hexadecimal contain <b>5A4D</b> (MZ in little endian) which identifies the file as an executable
                        üëå</p>
                    <h3>DOS stub :</h3>
                    <p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/8.png" alt="" /></span>With <b>PEstudio</b> we see the
                        stub
                        message which tells us that this program cannot be run in DOS mode. Note that PE files keep this
                        for backward compatibility with DOS. When run in DOS, a so-called DOS stub is executed which
                        prints this message and exits.</p>
                    <h3>File header :</h3>
                    <p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/9.png" alt="" /></span>Awesome, the signature defines
                        the file as a PE üëç, the malware was compiled on Mon Oct 17 04:48:13 2016 üòï and other
                        information that we have already found before üôÇ</p>
                    <h3>Optional header : </h3>
                    <p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/10.png" alt="" /></span>Great, we got a lot of
                        information here like where the first instruction of the malware is executed (entry-point),
                        the OS version (4.0), the subsystem used (Graphical User Interface), etc ‚Ä¶ </p>
                    <h3>Sections :</h3>
                    <p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/11.png" alt="" /></span>In our case we have 4 sections :
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>.text</b> : contains the executable code.</li>
                            <li><b>.rdata</b> &amp; <b>.data</b> : stores data and addresses of particular library
                                functions imported or exported from DLLs.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>.reloc</b> : within this section is a base relocation table needed to fix up virtual
                                addresses.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h2>5. Libraries and imports :</h2>
                    <p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/12.png" alt="" /></span>As we can see it uses functions
                        from <b>wsock32.dll</b> and <b>wininet.dll</b> to establish Internet connections with the C&C
                        server through
                        POST requests. What we assumed before is true üòÆ and also in order to interact with registries
                        it uses functions from <b>advapi32.dll</b>, possibly for persistence üòß</p>
                    <p>Now we scroll through the <b>kernel32.dll</b> library which is used to interact with the
                        operating system :</p>
                    <p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/13.png" alt="" /></span>And we see that the malware has
                        the ability to create, read, write, delete files and interact with processes which is expected
                        from a credentials stealer üòé. Note that it uses the <b>LoadLibrary</b> function to dynamically
                        load
                        other libraries, so in other words what we got may not be all the libraries needed for its
                        functionality üòß</p>
                    <p>To go further in details, we must either reverse it using <b>Ghidra</b> for example, or analyze
                        it
                        dynamically with <b>Ollydbg</b> or <b>IDA Pro</b>.</p>
                    <p>Well there you go, I hope you liked it and don‚Äôt forget to leave a comment üòä. Well there you go,
                        I hope you liked it and don‚Äôt forget to leave a comment üòä</p>
                    <p>To be continued ‚Ä¶</p>
