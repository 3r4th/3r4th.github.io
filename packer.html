                    <p>In malware creation process, <b>obfuscation</b> of this one is essential in order to <b>avoid
                            detection</b>
                        and make <b>reverse engineering difficult</b>. Packing is a type of obfuscation
                        techniques.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are multiple packing tools available and they are very easy to use, here some popular ones
                        : <b>UPX</b>, <b>Themida</b>, <b>VMProtect</b>, <b>ExeStealth</b>, <b>Aegis Crypter</b>. But
                        many malware authors use custom-made tools 😈 and that is why I made this post to give you a
                        good idea of how it works 😉
                    </p>
                    <p>Well, for those who do not know what it is, here is a very quick definition :
                        <b>
                            <blockquote>packing is the
                                transformation of un executable to another one with a specific file system footprint.
                            </blockquote>
                        </b>
                    </p>
                    <p> Think of it as the process of encrypting the first executable (malware created) and appending a
                        piece of code called <b>"stub"</b> to it in order to decrypt it later to be executed on the
                        target
                        system. As for the stub, it is just a piece of code that contains the decryption agent used to
                        decrypt the packed malware.

                    </p>
                    <p>A packer can be useful <b>against static analysis</b> because it changes the signature of the
                        file which
                        circumvent such a thing. To make a packer, we have two main chalenges :

                        <ol>
                            <li>First of all, we have to create the stub which requires a good knowledge of the target
                                architecture, so if, for example, we target a Windows-based system, we need to know the
                                different system calls necessary to unpack, load and execute our malware thereafter 🤔
                            </li>
                            <li>Secondly, we need to inject the stub stealthily, for example as an additional section at
                                the end of the first executable as you can see below. Check <a href="pswd_stealer.html"
                                    target="_blank">this post</a> for more
                                information
                                about the PE format.
                                <span class="image fit"><img src="images/18.png" alt="" /></span></li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ⚠️ But wait a second, it is <b>suspicious</b> to do it <b>this way</b> because we have to point
                        our
                        <b>"entrypoint"</b> towards the stub which is so weird. Effectively, usually entrypoint
                        points to
                        the code section (the first section of an executable) and not to another section. Another
                        technique is to create a new executable from the first one but by putting our stub in the code
                        section and this is no longer suspect, because the code section will contain the encrypted data
                        (our evil code) and the stub 😮
                        <span class="image fit"><img src="images/19.png" alt="" /></span>
                    </p>
                    <p>Sorry but we will have another problem because the <b>"entropy"</b> of this new section will be
                        high and
                        does not look like a normal one which leads to detection. Do not worry, here is a solution 💡 :
                        <ol>
                            <li>Add the encrypted data to the resource section of a legitimate process.
                            </li>
                            <li>Then overwrite a portion of code of this new one with the stub and your packed malware
                                will look like this :
                                <span class="image fit"><img src="images/20.png" alt="" /></span></li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>Here are some techniques for getting around antivirus and what I've mentioned here should get you
                        started. I hope you liked it and take care 😊</p>
